description: During his lifetime, British fiction writer Wilkie Collins came to rival
  Charles Dickens in popularity and critical acclaim. Like Dickens, Collins often
  gravitated toward characters who overcame significant obstacles to learn important
  life lessons. The novella The Guilty River continues in this vein, recounting an
  against-all-odds love affair that blossoms between a couple that each hail from
  a different social caste.
